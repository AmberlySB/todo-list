<h1 align=center>Todo List Web App</h1>

#### [Live Preview](https://amberlysb.github.io/todo-list)

### Description

I took on this [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) as part of the [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum.

This is a todo list app with a design inspired by [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

With this app you can:

- Create, edit, delete, and complete your todos!
- Name your todos, provide a description, provide a dueDate, or set a priority level!
- Create and delete projects to manage different lists of todos!
- Responsive design for a good mobile & desktop experience!
- Utilizes local storage to persist your todos & projects between sessions on your device!

### Tech Stack

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- Vanilla javascript
- Vite

### Learning Outcomes

I learned a lot about working with objects on this project. A few key concepts that I learned about regarding objects include:

- Object destructuring
- Object.freeze method for making objects immutable

I learned about the observer design pattern, and used observers to prevent code from becoming to tightly coupled.

I learned about using local storage to store and retrieve user data from session to session through it's associated methods:

- localStorage.setItem()
- localStorage.getItem()
- localStorage.removeItem()
- localStorage.clear()

I learned about using JSON to store and retrieve data through it's associated methods:

- JSON.stringify()
- JSON.parse()
- toJSON()

### Things to come back to:

- Add view to see all todos due today.
- Add view to see all todos due in the next week.
